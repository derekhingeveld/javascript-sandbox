What Is An API?
• Application Programming Interface
• Contract provided by one piece of software to another
• Structured request and response
• We just worked with an API that takes a request and responds with jokes

REST APIS
• Representation State Transfer
• Architecture style for designing networked applications
• Relies on a stateless, client-server protocol, almost always HTTP
• Treats server objects as resources that can be created or destroyed
• Can be used by virtually any programming language
• All APIS have their own rules and structure

HTTP Requests
• GET: Retrieve data from a specified resource
• POST: Submit data to be processed to a specific resource
• PUT: Update a specified resource
• DELETE: Delete a specified resource

• HEAD: Same as get but does not return a body
• OPTIONS: Returns the supported HTTP methods
• PATCH: Update partial resources
